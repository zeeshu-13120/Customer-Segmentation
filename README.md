# \# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Project

# 

# This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on their \*\*Annual Income\*\* and \*\*Spending Score\*\* using \*\*K-Means\*\* and \*\*DBSCAN\*\* clustering algorithms. The goal is to identify customer behavior patterns that can help businesses develop more targeted and effective marketing strategies.

# 

# \## 📌 Project Overview

# 

# The workflow followed in this project includes:

# 

# \- \*\*📊 Data Exploration \& Preprocessing\*\*  

# &nbsp; Understand the dataset, clean missing values, and prepare for analysis.

# 

# \- \*\*🧠 Clustering Model Development\*\*  

# &nbsp; Apply \*\*K-Means\*\* and \*\*DBSCAN\*\* to identify customer segments.

# 

# \- \*\*📈 Model Evaluation \& Interpretation\*\*  

# &nbsp; Determine the optimal number of clusters using metrics and visualize clusters.

# 

# \- \*\*🔍 Advanced Exploration\*\*  

# &nbsp; Perform deeper analysis using DBSCAN and analyze cluster-based spending patterns.

# 

# \- \*\*🖼️ Visualization\*\*  

# &nbsp; Create clear plots to represent and understand customer groupings.
